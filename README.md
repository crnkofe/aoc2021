# AOC' 2021

This year it's Kotlin time! Project can be tried out by opening it with
an Intellij community edition (to be more exact - IntelliJ IDEA 2021.3 (Community Edition)).

Each day is a separate module with a `fun main` that can be run directly through the IDE.

Sample input data is in `./data` folder.

Enjoy the holiday season!
